Emotive Exceptions
==================

![Example Screenshot. Displays a screenshot of an angry emoticon being thrown as an exception.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishalebarnes/EmotiveExceptions/master/Example.png?raw=true)

Exceptions are hard to handle. Using Emotive Exceptions to throw will increase the expressiveness of exception handling code. Typing out exception names is time consuming and verbose.  There is a more terse and better way!

## Getting Started
To throw an exception of type Exception, simply throw a new look of disapproval.

    throw new ಠ_ಠ { };

Got a NullReferenceException?  Throw a new confused face instead.

	throw new O_o { };

There are a lot more kinds of Emotive Exceptions, see [EmotiveExceptionsTest.cs](https://github.com/chrishalebarnes/EmotiveExceptions/blob/master/EmotiveExceptions.Test/EmotiveExceptionsTest.cs) for more examples.

If you have a more expressive exception type to add send a pull request!
